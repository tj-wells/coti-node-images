# Coti Node Image Builder

This repository uses GitHub Actions to periodically check for new coti-node <a href="https://github.com/coti-io/coti-node/releases" target="_blank">releases</a>, and if a new release is found, a container image of the release is automatically built in an open-source and publicly transparent way, so that the images generated by this repository can be trusted. These are not official images, and are produced by the Coti community, for the Coti community to.

If you have ideas or input for the Coti node images, please feel free to let me know or make a pull request.

# What does this Repository do?

This repository uses <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> to check for new releases of the <a href="https://github.com/coti-io/coti-node">official coti-node repository</a>, and if a new version is found, it builds a Docker image of the new release, and pushed it to Dockerhub.

Below is a description of the important components to this reponsitory:
- The GitHub Action workflow file itself, that describes the build process, is at <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-image.yml"  target="_blank">.github/workflows/update-image.yml</a>.
- To view recent runs of the workflows themselves, <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/actions"  target="_blank">click here</a>.
- The images produced by this repository can be found in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/atomnode/coti-node"  target="_blank">this Dockerhub container registry</a>.
- <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/update-env" target="_blank">update-env</a> is the script used to build a `fullnode.properties` file from the environment variables inside the Docker container. It also downloads the appropriate clustestamp file for MainNet or TestNet when necessary.

# Overview of the Build Process

This section gives a high-level overview of the build process executed by <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-image.yml" target="_blank">this workflow file</a>.

Most of the workflow file is general to any github action that builds a container image and pushes it to a container registry. The important step, in which slight modifications are made to the basic Coti node repository, is one called "Modify coti-node Repository", which performs the following operations before executing the build:

1. Clones the official Coti release.
2. Copy a script (<a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/update-env" target="_blank">update-env</a>), which uses the container's environment variables to generate a new `fullnode.properties` file.

# Workflow runs that created previous images

Since there are many workflow runs in which no image is built, it can become hard to find the workflow runs that actually generated new Docker images. A log of the Docker images of each new version of the Coti software and the workflow runs that built them will be kept below.

| Coti Node Version | Workflow Run | Dockerhub Image |
| :---------------: | :----------: | :-------------: |
| 3.1.3  | <a href="https://github.com/tomjwells/coti-node-images/actions/runs/4199560627">4199560627</a>  | <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/atomnode/coti-node/3.1.3/images/sha256-143cd458730407585b5bb50eef658e3104cd38e251504d779e7e6dd0cd20b725?context=repo">3.1.3</a> |
