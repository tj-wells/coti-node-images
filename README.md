# Coti Node Image Builder

This repository supplements the repository, <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node" target="_blank">Coti Node Docker Installation Method</a>, which proposes a simple method for installing and maintaining Coti nodes using Docker containers.

This repository executes the build process of the coti-node images in an open-source and publicly transparent way, so that the images it generates can be trusted.

Readers are encouraged to clone or fork the respository to make their own images, or use the scripts here to inspire their own scripts and variations. Alternatively, if you have ideas for how the images can be improved, feel free to let me know or make a pull request.

# What does this Repository do?

This repository uses Github actions to check for new releases of the <a href="https://github.com/coti-io/coti-node">official coti-node repository</a>, and if a new version is found, a Docker image of the release is built.

# Overview of the Build Process

This section gives a high-level overview of the build process executed by <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-image.yml" target="_blank">this workflow file</a>.

The workflow file might seem as if a lot is going on, but most of it is general to any github action that builds a container image and pushes it to a registry. The important step to understand is the one called "Modify coti-node Repository", which performs the following operations before executing the build:

1. Clone the official Coti release.
2. Copy a script (<a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/update-env" target="_blank">update-env</a>), which uses the container's environment variables to generate a new `fullnode.properties` file.
