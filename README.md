# Coti Node Image Builder

This repository periodically checks the releases of the official [coti-node](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-node/releases) repository, and if a new release is available, a Docker image of the release is automatically built and pushed to [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/atomnode/coti-node/tags). The advantage of doing this process in GitHub actions, is that not only is the code open-source and transparent, but the *builds* of the images themselves are too. These images are produced by a Coti community member, for the Coti community to use as they wish.

Please dig in to the code. If you have ideas or input for the Coti node images, please feel free to let me know or make a pull request.

# Which files are involved in the build process?

The contents of this repo are kept deliberately minimal, so as to make as few changes as possible to the base Coti node software. 

Below are the three files involved in the build process:

- [.github/workflows/update-image.yml](https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-image.yml) - The GitHub Action workflow file itself, that describes the build process
- [check-for-new-release](https://github.com/tomjwells/coti-node-images/blob/master/check-for-new-release) - A python script called by update-image.yml, which is simply used to check that the latest Coti node version matches the latest Docker image.
- [create-properties](https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/create-properties) - A script that generates a  `fullnode.properties` file from the environment variables. This is to be run in the Docker container before launching the main Coti node program. It also downloads the appropriate clusterstamp file for MainNet or TestNet when necessary.

# üê≥ Overview of the Build Process

This section gives a high-level overview of the build process executed by <a href="https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/.github/workflows/update-image.yml" target="_blank">this workflow file</a>.

Most of the workflow file is general to any GitHub action that builds a container image and pushes it to a container registry. The important step, in which slight modifications are made to the basic Coti node repository, is one called "Modify coti-node Repository", which performs the following operations before executing the build:

1. Clones the official Coti release.
2. Copy a script ([create-properties](https://github.com/tj-wells/coti-node-images/blob/master/create-properties)), which uses the container's environment variables to generate a new `fullnode.properties` file.

# Workflow runs that created previous images

Since there are many workflow runs in which no image is built, it can be difficult to find the workflow runs that actually created new Docker images. The table below is used to keep a log of the Docker images of each new version of the Coti software and the workflow runs that built them.

# How Can I Use these Docker Images?

See [this repository](https://github.com/tomjwells/coti-node) for an example and accompanying guide that suggests a method for running a Coti node using Docker. This repository contains the exact `docker-compose` files I use to run my node.
